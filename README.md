# Github Timeline

The goal is to present my GitHub repositories in a somewhat more visual and easily digestible manner. To achieve this I use the GitHub REST API to get my GitHub user account information. If you're reading this part, the visual is probably still taken from W3School vertical timeline example but I do plan on customizing it later.
